# Heart-Failure-Predictions-New
**1 Introduction:**

Heart Disease are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for 1% of all deaths , with an estimate 17.7 million lives lost each year beacuse of heart disease. 
Cardiovascular Disease could be from heart attacks and strokes and could happen for prematurly people under 70. Since the heart dfailur is commen cardivasdul deiase, I try to build a model that predict heart faiulure which help to predict a potenital heart disease.


**1.2 Data:**

Our data is from Kaggle and It hast 918 observation and 12 varible including the response varible named HeartDisease with a value of 0 (noraml) or (Heart Diseas).
To explain some of the important variable, could be old peak and ST_slop are the feature of excerise electrocardiogram(ECG). Oldpeak is St depression include by excrise relative to rest and low eadinfg can be sing of resduce blood flow to the heart muscle. St slop refers to the disrection adn change in the St segment ofd ECG. The upslcing ST segment may be a normal fininf in younger individiuals who are physiocally active while a downslopingh St can be indicative of cornory arter diseas or other cardiac conditioin .
